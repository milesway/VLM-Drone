# 🧑‍💻 Interactive Information Access and Debugging

We designed a very informative (and good-looking, hopefully) interface for accessing internal information and all the available attributes of objects created in Genesis, implemented via the `__repr__()` method for all the Genesis classes. This feature will be very useful if you are used to debugging via either `IPython` or `pdb` or `ipdb`.

Let's use `IPython` in this example. Install it via `pip install ipython` if you don't have it. Let's go through a simple example here:
```python
import genesis as gs

gs.init()

scene = gs.Scene(show_viewer=False)

plane = scene.add_entity(gs.morphs.Plane())
franka = scene.add_entity(
    gs.morphs.MJCF(file='xml/franka_emika_panda/panda.xml'),
)

cam_0 = scene.add_camera()
scene.build()

# enter IPython's interactive mode
import IPython; IPython.embed()
```

You can either run this script directly (if you have `IPython` installed), or you can just enter an `IPython` interactive window in terminal and past the code here without the last line.

In this small block of code, we added a plane entity and a Franka arm. Now, if you are a newbie, you would probably be wondering what a scene actually contains. If you simply type `scene` in `IPython` (or `ipdb` or `pdb` or even a native python shell), you will see everything inside the scene, formatted and colorized nicely:

```{figure} ../../_static/images/interactive_scene.png
```

In the top line, you will see the type of the object (`<gs.Scene>` in this case). Then you will see all the available attributes inside it. For example, it tells you that the scene is built (`is_built` is `True`), its timestep (`dt`) is a float of value `0.01` seconds, and it unique id (`uid`) is `'69be70e-dc9574f508c7a4c4de957ceb5'`. The scene also has an attribute called `solvers`, which is essentially a list of different physics solvers it has. You can further type `scene.solvers` inside the shell and inspect this list, which is implemented using a `gs.List` class for better visualization:

```{figure} ../../_static/images/interactive_solvers.png
```

You can also inspect the Franka entity:

```{figure} ../../_static/images/interactive_franka.png
```
Here you would see all the `geoms` and `links` it has and associated information. We can go one layer deeper, and type `franka.links[0]`:


```{figure} ../../_static/images/interactive_link.png
```
Here you will see all the collision geoms (`geoms`) and visual geoms (`vgeoms`) included in the link, and other important information such as its `intertial_mass`, the link's global index in the scene (`idx`), which entity it belongs to (`entity`, which is the franka arm entity), its joint (`joint`), etc.

We hope this informative interface can make your debugging process easier!
