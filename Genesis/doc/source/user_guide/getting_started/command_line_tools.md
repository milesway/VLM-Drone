# üñ•Ô∏è Command Line Tools

We provided some command line tools that you can execute in terminal once Genesis is installed. These include:

- `gs clean`: Clean all the files cached by genesis and taichi
- `gs view *.*`: Visualize a given asset (mesh/URDF/MJCF) (can be useful if you want to quickly check if your asset can be loaded and visualized correctly)
- `gs animate 'path/*.png'`: Combine all images that matches the given pattern into a video.
