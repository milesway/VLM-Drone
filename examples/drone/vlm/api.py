Key Requirements:
- Drones can be reassigned to different targets between planning steps.
- You must ensure drones' paths and waypoints avoid collisions, keeping at least the minimum safe distance between all drones.
- Drones are considered to have reached their assigned target when their distance to it is less than the specified threshold.
- IMPORTANT: Always provide waypoints for ALL drones, even if they have reached their targets.
- For drones that have completed their targets: set their waypoint to their assigned target position (they should hover at the target).
- For drones still moving to targets: provide the next waypoint they should move toward.
- You must also decide how many steps these waypoints are valid for (n_steps) before replanning is needed.
- Additionally, provide clear reasoning for your assignments and waypoint choices.
- Your output must be valid JSON, following the schema provided.
- Learn from previous interactions to improve your planning decisions."""
